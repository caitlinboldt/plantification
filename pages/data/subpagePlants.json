Tomatoes do not like the cold, so do not put them out too early. Make sure you harden off or gradually acclimate seedlings to outside living before you plant them. When planting tomato seedlings, remove the seed leaves and the first set of true leaves and place the bottom half of the seedling in the ground. Tomatoes are planted much deeper than most plants"

But older varieties can be rambunctious plants, spreading widely and covered in thorns that made harvesting a painful chore. Newer cultivars are much better behaved and thornless. Moreover, planting a mix of early, mid-season, and late-season varieties will extend your harvest for weeks. The plants do require annual pruning to keep them productive, but it is a quick job. The goal with pruning is to thin the plants enough that light and air can reach all parts. This benefits growth and helps to prevent disease."

One of the most significant benefits of planting peppers in containers is that you can move your plants inside if continuously stormy weather threatens your area for several days. Peppers come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Hot peppers range in spice level from mild to searing to hardly edible."
